# Example Defense Routines
## Team Indiana (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Gt1tazM0ig)
### Portcullis
Drivetrain:
+ accelerates to get up ramp (aka defense platform), but ends up bumping into door of arched gateway

Arm:
+ needs to be quick to grab door and lift above, because drivetrain cannot sustain on ramp

### Drawbridge
Drivetrain:
+ accelerates across board and risks snapping motion onto robot

Arm:
+ after lifting door, it unfolds to the ground
+ retracts so that it doesn't scrape going up ramp once drivetrain reaches the flat part of ramp

### Cheval de Frise
Drivetrain:
+ inch way up, cannot accelerate

Arm:
+ unfolds arm perpendicular to push boards of Cheval de Frise to become flat platform

### Sally Port
+ Indiana team assumes sally port doesn't retract-- very amateur drive through the sally port

### Rough Terrain & Moat
+ just runs through it
